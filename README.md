# simplegraphds
A simple graph data structure managing framework


This data structure implementation is different from the one which you may find any where on internet.

Node object contains information like

    -- Data; type of this data is generic

    -- ID; a unique identifier, two node children cant have same node ID belonging to same parent root

    -- Tag; similar kind of nodes can be tagged and searched on the basis of tag name. Also they can be used as relationship between two nodes 

    -- Desc; give a description to a node

Node objects are not directly accessible its accessible through graph object
